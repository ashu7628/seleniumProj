How to Run the Code
Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can check this by running:

python --version
or
python3 --version

Create a virtual environment using the following command:
python -m venv vs
(Replace python3 with python if your system uses it as the default.)

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
source vs/Scripts/activate



Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies by running:
pip install google-cloud-translate selenium requests
pip install webdriver-manager
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start the application by running:
python3 app.py
(Again, replace python3 with python if necessary.)
